We are always actively seeking feedback on Behave Pro, one common item is around usability. We have spent 
time improving the Specification Page and we would like your [feedback](http://feedback.hindsightsoftware.com/forums/261522-behave-pro/suggestions/6281992-redesign-the-specification-page-to-more-user-frien) 
before we release it. Watch the following video to see the new Specification Page and how your JIRA 
Administrator can enable it today so you can try it for yourself.
