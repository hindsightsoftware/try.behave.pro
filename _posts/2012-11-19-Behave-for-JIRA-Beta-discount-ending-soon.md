It's hard to believe its only been 18 weeks since we released the first Beta version of Behave for JIRA.
This period of time has featured some major milestones:

 * Winning "Best Marketplace paid add-on" in Atlassian's Codegeist competition
 
 * Working with global evaluators including banks, airlines, tv companies, global media companies and international software houses
 
 * Released new features including, support for Ruby, selective test execution and full support for Cucumber.

The great news is that the full release of Behave for JIRA is fast approaching - something we are very excited about.

However, this means that the 50% discount we have been offering for your massively helpful feedback on our product will be ending very soon.
