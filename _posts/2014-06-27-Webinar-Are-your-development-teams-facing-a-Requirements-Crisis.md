**Webinar - Are your development teams facing a Requirements Crisis?**

*Is the answer in . . . Behaviour Driven Development*

Regardless of the main focus of the business, all firms today face the constant challenge of ever-changing market conditions, a rapidly evolving regulatory landscape and increased competition in their business. To keep up, they are increasingly reliant on new software development.

But frequently what is needed is not what is delivered.

We would like to invite you to join a webinar at 4pm BST on Tuesday 15th July to discuss some of the issues around what many are seeing as a Requirements Crisis and how Behaviour Driven Development (BDD) techniques could be the answer. BDD is a communication and collaboration technique, specifically focused on reducing misinterpretation of specifications as software is developed.

Some of the leading exponents of BDD have contributed to the just released Financial Markets Insights document (available for free download below).  These challenges apply whichever industry you are in.

We invite you to listen to what they have to say and join the discussion.
