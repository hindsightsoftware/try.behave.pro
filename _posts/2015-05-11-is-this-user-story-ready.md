Before work can start on a User Story or Issue the team needs to have a discussion with the Product Owner to understand the Requirements or the wrong “thing” will be be delivered. Everyone in the Team should be involved in this discussion to build a common understanding and BDD helps further by using Examples to clarify the requirements and build a ubiquitous language amongst the team.

JIRA Admins often add a "Approved" or "Signed off" step to the Issue Workflow. These steps only allow one or two people to be involved in the process and it doesn’t captures if the whole teams understands. To remedy this we have created the “Ready” button, a simple way for team members to communicate their understanding using the simplicity of the Facebook “Like” button concept.
