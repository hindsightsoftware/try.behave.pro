At Hindsight, we’re big fans of BDD, (in case you hadn’t noticed) and we’re constantly working towards making it easier 
for everyone to experience the benefits for themselves. With collaboration and communication at the heart of User 
Stories and BDD, we continually look into how we can take this to next step, particularly with for remote and 
distributed teams.

##Introducing Behave Pro’s integration with HipChat
	
Understanding and writing User Stories has always relied upon discussions and asking questions, and Behave Pro for JIRA 
has supported this through our ["Questions" workflow](/blog/updates/bdd/2015/131/is-this-user-story-ready.html). Behave Pro for HipChat now extends this 
workflow from JIRA into your favourite team chat tool. This makes it ideal for remote and distributed teams to discuss 
User Stories and provides a chat history for future reference, making it valuable for co-located teams as well.
	
Behave Pro adds the Issue Glance to the right hand panel of your HipChat Client. The glance shows the number of Issues 
blocked by questions in your current sprint or on your kanban board, and a simple click will open the Issues and 
Questions - meaning you won’t have to leave HipChat to discuss and answer team members questions
