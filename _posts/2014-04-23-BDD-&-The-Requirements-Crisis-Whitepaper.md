Are Financial Markets Facing a Requirements Crisis?      
And does the answer lie in Behaviour-Driven Development?
 
In this article, Mike O'Hara from the Trading Mesh interviews Alan Parkinson of Hindsight Software. The whitepaper also includes contributions from Dan North, Chris Matts, Liz Keogh, Konstantin Kudryashov and David Evans. It looks at how a number of firms in the Financial sector are turning Behaviour-Driven Development (BDD) to ensure that complex requirements are identified, specified, communicated and continuously delivered.
