Got the burning desire to learn Cucumber-JVM but don't know where to start? We are pleased to announce that we will be running a one day tutorial on "BDD with Cucumber-JVM" at jDays  Gothenburg on the 5th of December. The tutorial is free for all the attendees of jDays, a three day conference for Java professionals held at the Swedish Exhibition & Congress Centre, Gothenburg
Sweden. Full details are available at the [jDays website](http://www.jdays.se/course-information/) 

The one day tutorial will give a strong foundation in Cucumber JVM, a rewrite of Cuke4Duke, the tool many Java developers use for writing and running BDD style acceptance tests. The main focus of this course will be on how to write automated acceptance tests for BDD scenarios, though there will be an introduction to BDD given for people not familiar with it.

### Topics covered:

* BDD basics

* Automating scenarios by writing Java glue code for Cucumber-JVM

* How to run automated Scenarios using JUnit or Maven

* Grouping scenarios and selecting what gets run with Tags

* Writing common set-up and tear down code for automated scenario's using hooks (@Before and @After)
