Specification Workshops, a key part of the BDD cycle, allow specifications to harness the knowledge and experience of all stakeholders on the team. This is achieved by discussing and creating scenarios for the stories that are planned for the iteration. However, one of the specifications workshops biggest strengths is also its biggest weakness. The conversation often moves at such a pace it is difficult for a scribe to keep up, and stopping and starting is not only inefficient but a waste of what could be much more productive time. To address this problem, we suggest using a dictaphone.

Place a dictaphone in the middle of the room, set to record and then forget about it for the duration of the meeting. After the meeting, it can be given to somebody to type up the key points e.g. the Scenarios. That way, the conversation can continue itâ€™s natural flow and can then be reviewed by one team member. This can make meetings shorter, more productive as there are no breaks in conversation flow, and keep present parties more attentive. This also makes the best use of the Product Owner's typically strained time.
