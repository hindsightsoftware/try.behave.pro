Outside-In Development (OID) is a way of thinking which helps ensure that every line of code your team writes is benefiting the project stakeholders. Complementary of Agile methodologies, OID does not require a complete change to your development methodology, moreover the way you encourage your team to think about the impact the software they are building will have for the stakeholders.

The main principle of OID is prioritisation of features that stakeholders feel will provide to most value to the project. It is important for teams to be explicit about who the stakeholders are, being careful not to omit internal stakeholders such as Business Partners, architects and Product Owners. These stakeholders than come together and discuss what features should be developed next. The feature given the highest priority is the feature which is a hybrid of providing the most value to the largest amount of stakeholders.

The largest benefit of OID is an understanding of the stakeholders goals. These often change as stakeholders react to changes in their own circumstances and contexts so OID allows the flexibility to keep creating relevant features. This is one of the biggest benefits, as Inside-Out Development (IOD) often results in redundant features by the time build is complete as it does not maintain the same adaptability as OID.

BDD is an example of OID. In BDD, the scenarios attached to user stories are written in natural language, allowing all stakeholders, including the not-so-technically minded, to understand the purpose of each user story, and how it will affect the behaviour of the product. Another example of the OID elements of BDD is that fact that BAâ€™s write acceptance criteria in user stories that define acceptable system behavior.
