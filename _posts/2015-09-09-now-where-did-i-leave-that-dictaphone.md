A few months ago, we encouraged the use of a dictaphone during Specification Workshops in order to capture natural conversations. But what if you don’t have easy access to a dictaphone? This got us looking for some other options, so below we have outlined some easily available dictaphone imitations. We’ve even included some transcription services!

### Android

#### [Smart Voice Recorder](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.andrwq.recorder)
**Free** &#9733;&#9733;&#9733;&#9733;&#9734;

A Dictaphone that skips any silence in the meeting, leaving you time to think! 

#### [Easy Voice Recorder](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.coffeebeanventures.easyvoicerecorder)
**Free** &#9733;&#9733;&#9733;&#9733;&#9734;

A simple dictaphone which allows unlimited continuous voice recordings and share to Drive, Dropbox or E-Mail.

### iOS

#### [Dictaphone - Audio Recorder](https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/dictaphone-audio-recorder/id595361888?mt=8)
**Free** &#9733;&#9733;&#9733;&#9733;&#9734;

A simple, Dictaphone app which records using your iPhone/iPad. Can be exported as an MP3 or WAV file. It also supports external mics. Playback speed can be slowed for ease of transcription.

#### [d2u Transcriber](https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/d2u-transcriber-dictation/id341741314?mt=8)
**Free** &#9733;&#9733;&#9733;&#9733;&#9734; (Transcription £1.55 Per minute of audio)

As well as being a Dictaphone, the audio recording can then be edited and encrypted, then sent to a typist to transcribe your recording. A microsoft word file is then returned within 24 hours.

### Windows Phone

#### [Clever Recorder](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/store/apps/clever-recorder/9wzdncrcwb2k )

### PC

#### [dictation.io](https://dictation.io)
**Free**

Web app which generates Speech-to-Text, ready to be exported to Google Drive, Dropbox or your Computer. Probably best used in conjunction with a recording so it is possible to remedy inaccuracies post-event.

#### [Vocaroo] (www.vocaroo.com)

Online voice recorder. Available to export as an Email attachment or download as an MP3 or WAV.
