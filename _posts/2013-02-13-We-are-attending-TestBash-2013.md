As active members of the testing community some of the Hindsight team will be attending [TestBash 2013](http://www.ministryoftesting.com/training-events/testbash-2-0/) on March 22nd in Brighton, UK. Anyone who wants to chat about Selenium, the testers role in Behaviour Driven Development or Cucumber-JVM should look out for our CEO Alan Parkinson. Just grab him, he won't mind.

We won't just be at the conference itself, but participating in all the other events going on around it. There is a [Meetup](http://www.meetup.com/SoftwareTestingClub/events/98960732/) the night before, a early [morning run](http://www.meetup.com/SoftwareTestingClub/events/107031452/) to wake up the brain, [LeanCoffee/LeanTea](http://www.meetup.com/SoftwareTestingClub/events/107498512/) before the conference starts and the [social night](http://www.meetup.com/SoftwareTestingClub/events/98961052/) after the conference itself. That's one packed schedule with plenty of time for a chat.
