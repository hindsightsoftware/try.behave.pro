On the 4th of April the annual [CukeUp! Conference](http://skillsmatter.com/event/java-jee/cukeup-2013) for Cucumber and related tools. [Gideon Goldberg](http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/gideon-goldberg) from the software 
testing team at The Guardian newspaper has [written a digest](http://www.guardian.co.uk/info/developer-blog/2013/apr/10/cukeup-2013-conference-digest-gherkin-bdd) of the 
conference written in the Gherkin format of Cucumber. Gideon has managed to successfully distil my own talk from CukeUp! in to its simplest form.

    Scenario: Creating data with the Test Data Builder pattern

      Given your tests require test data to be populated as a prerequisite
      Then you should create this data using the Test Data Builder Pattern
      And this data should be created through APIs
      But not through SQL or UI manipulation

If this simple summary of my talk has caught your interest you can watch the real thing on the [Skills Matter](http://skillsmatter.com/podcast/java-jee/creating-data-with-the-test-data-builder-pattern) website.
