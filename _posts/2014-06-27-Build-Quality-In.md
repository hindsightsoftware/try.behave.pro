Alan Parkinson, CEO of Hindsight Software, is contributing to a book called 'Build Quality In'.

Alan will be discussing Hindsights Continuous Delivery journey with Behave Pro. He will share Hindsight's experiences of what worked, what didn't, and how Continuous Delivery helped build a resilient and robust product - that adds real value for our customers.

70% of the profits are going to code club, a not-for-profit organisation that runs a UK-wide network of free volunteer-led after-school coding clubs for children aged 9-11.

The book is being curated and edited by Steve Smith and Matthew Skelton and can be bought on LeanPub.
